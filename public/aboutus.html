        <p style="color: white; font-size: 20px;">TravlAwsm – “Explore and Embrace” is a platform which helps the 
            tourism industry revive back as soon as possible. The revival of this industry is very important from many aspects.
             Once the lockdown and travel restrictions start easing and countries start opening up their borders again people can visit and plan out their journeys again.
              But due to lack of information it might be difficult for the people as what and how to prepare during and post covid era and also much more than that.
               It is at this time that TravlAwsm is going to be your best partner and advisor as well. The travelers can look for a particular place where they are planning
             to visit and gather all the necessary information through the site and thus preparing accordingly. </p>
